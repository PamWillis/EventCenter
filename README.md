  ## Description
  
  This Event Center is a place for people to come together and find events. To see what vendors are attending and view vendors individualy in order to attend.  
      - This interactive MERN Stack application was created to highlight the use of react components and the ease of how it can hide and show components to easily map through the pages.  
    - The challenge inspired more study within react, design and layout. Looking into React it was interesting to find all that it could do and how javascript breaks down exactly what will show.  
    - React creates the ability to keep the header and footer the same while changing out the body for each page. This saves on coding and therefore speeds up the site.  
    - Material-Tailwinds, CSS and HTML are treated differently in React and are better organized to be particular for each page. This project also gave a better understanding of the supporting javascript needed to change out the particular items.   
     - The use of graphql was implemented using Models and Schemas: including typeDefs & Resolvers. Mutations and Queeries were created within the Schemas and then used on the client side.  
    - Vite tool was installed as a developer tool to see immediate changes as they were happening.
